# Run InTime in Tcl Mode
This repository contains scripts to run InTime in the Tcl Console or on the command-line. 

## Contents
1. configuration/ : Ways to set up InTime for your FPGA toolchains.
2. examples/ : Sample designs for the various flows described here.
3. images/ : Pictures used to illustrate various steps.
4. scripts/ : Sample scripts you can try to see how the optimization flow works with your FPGA toolchains.

Currently, most of the scripts provided support Vivado in both project and non-project modes. In non-project mode, only a post-synthesis **DCP** file is supported at this time. 

To use the InTime GUI, refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvY_XZ3R7w).

## Requirements
1. Latest version of InTime.
2. At least a copy of Vivado and its license properly registered in InTime. If you have not done so, please refer to this [page](https://github.com/plunify/InTime/tree/master/configuration)

## Steps
1. Download the scripts in the repository. There are 2 main scripts. 
[`intimeflow.tcl`](intimeflow.tcl) is an optimization Tcl script for InTime. The start_intime_vivado_*.tcl is a wrapper to configure your environment before running the optimization script.

### Option A - Use the Vivado Tcl Console
1. Edit [`start_intime_vivado_windows.tcl`](start_intime_vivado_windows.tcl) or [`start_intime_vivado_linux.tcl`](start_intime_vivado_linux.tcl) script to configure the environment, e.g. project path etc. 
2. Open the Tcl Console and source the script.
![alt text](https://github.com/plunify/InTime/blob/master/images/VivadoTclConsole_windows.png "Vivado Tcl Console - Windows") 
3. This script runs the InTime executable and passes in a custom InTime optimization script called `intimeflow.tcl`

Contents of intimeflow.tcl are:
```flow reset
flow set run_target local
flow set runs_per_round 2
flow set rounds 1
flow set concurrent_runs 1
flow set control_create_bitstreams false
flow run_recipe "hot_start"
```
The sample flow runs 1 round containing 2 generated builds and does 1 build at a time. To customize this flow, refer to this [page](https://docs.plunify.com/intime/flow_properties.html). 

### Option B - Run in a command-line terminal (Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)

#### Linux

Either run the flow directly in a command-line terminal or use the provided shell script [`start_intime_linux_shell.sh`](start_intime_linux_shell.sh). Similar to the Tcl script, you will need to configure your environment in the shell script before running it.

To run it directly, use a command like the one below:

```intime.sh -mode batch -platform minimal -project yourproject.xpr -vendor_toolchain vivado -vendor_toolchain_version 2018.3.0 -s intimeflow.tcl```

#### Windows

```"C:/intime.exe" -mode batch -platform minimal -project C:/yourproject.xpr -vendor_toolchain vivado -vendor_toolchain_version 2018.3.0 -s C:/intimeflow.tcl```

#### Description of arguments:
1. `intime.sh or intime.exe` Change this to the location of intime.sh or intime.exe in your environment.
2. `-mode batch` Tells InTime to operate in batch mode.
3. `-platform minimal` Tells InTime to operate in non-GUI mode.
4. `-project` Design to optimize â€“ specify your XPR or DCP file.
5. `-vendor_toolchain` Specify your FPGA vendor tools 
6. `-vendor_toolchain_version` Use the specified Vivado version.
7. `-s` Runs an InTime Tcl script. Change this to point to the InTime Tcl script that you are creating.
8. `>@ stdout` Echo output to the terminal as InTime runs.
