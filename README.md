InTime is a machine learning software that optimizes FPGA timing and performance. FPGA tools such as Vivado, Quartus and ISE provide massive optimization benefits with the right settings and techniques. InTime has built-in intelligence to identify such optimized strategies for synthesis and place-and-route. It actively learns from results to improve over time, extracting more than 50% increase in design performance from the FPGA tools.
